  "summary": "Diff shows frontend work toward a hide/unhide toggle (computing `shouldHide: !isCurrentlyHidden`, English toast text, and a local `AdminCompetitionResult` type with `isHidden`). However, there is no evidence in the provided diff summary of the required Motoko backend changes to persist and return a reliable per-result hidden flag for admin listings, and the Admin Results table rendering is truncated so the UI’s per-row state reflection cannot be confirmed. There are also modifications in AdminUsersPage/project metadata that appear unrelated to the requested change.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-72",
      "requirement": "Backend admin results listing includes an explicit boolean field indicating whether the result is currently hidden (persisted server-side) and the frontend uses that field to render per-row state and allow both hide and unhide after reload.",
      "reason": "The diff summary contains no backend (Motoko) changes (e.g., backend/main.mo) showing persistence of hidden state or inclusion of an explicit hidden boolean in the admin results listing response. The AdminResultsPage table rendering is truncated, so it cannot be verified that the UI uses a backend-provided `isHidden` flag per row (and not a frontend guess) to display Hide vs Unhide after reload.",
