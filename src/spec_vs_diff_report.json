  "summary": "The diff updates `frontend/public/env.json` with a non-placeholder `BACKEND_CANISTER_ID`, but there is no verifiable evidence of deploying a new backend canister or rerunning/completing the full go-live deploy flow. The diff also includes additional code and metadata changes (backend + preflight logic + project state summaries) that were not requested and conflict with the “do not change anything else than necessary” constraint.",

      "id": "REQ-91",
      "requirement": "Deploy a NEW backend canister (new canister ID) and record the newly created backend canister ID for use by the frontend configuration.",
      "reason": "The diff shows code changes to `backend/main.mo` but does not show any deployment artifacts, canister creation logs, dfx configuration updates, or other evidence that a new canister was actually created/deployed and that its new ID was captured as part of the deployment process.",

      "requirement": "Run the go-live build + deploy flow again after updating `frontend/public/env.json` and ensure it completes successfully without deployment errors.",
      "reason": "There is no evidence in the diff of running the go-live flow, its outputs, CI logs, or any deployment success indicators. Code changes alone do not demonstrate that the end-to-end flow completed successfully.",
