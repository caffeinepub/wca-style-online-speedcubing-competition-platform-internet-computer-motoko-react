  "summary": "REQ-116 is largely implemented by recording an inspectionStart timestamp on inspection start and calculating the inspection duration at solve start (SolveTimer onStart) to determine +2/DNF. However, the diff introduces new user-facing toast text for penalties, which conflicts with the requirement to keep existing messages/toasts unchanged.",

      "id": "REQ-116",
      "requirement": "The existing user-facing messages/toasts for +2 and DNF remain in English and are triggered based on the corrected timing.",
      "reason": "The diff shows new toast message strings being introduced for the +2 and DNF inspection penalties, rather than preserving the existing user-facing messages/toasts.",
