  "summary": "Full-stack online speedcubing competition platform with multi-event, WCA-style 5-solve flow, manual external payment-link based entry (replacing Razorpay checkout) with user “Request approval” flow and admin approvals panel, strong integrity controls (session lock, progressive scrambles, recovery), WCA Ao5 rules server-side validated, post-completion UX enhancements, leaderboard discoverability, pricing enhancements, and a registration-start date feature that gates starting until a specified datetime and auto-transitions upcoming competitions to running at that time.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Tech stack: Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM + NextAuth; deploy on Vercel.",
    "Competition format mirrors WCA-style online comps: 5 scrambles/solves with inspection and penalties.",
    "Result integrity enforced server-side: no client-side trust for attempt counts; validate session/ownership and prevent duplicate submissions.",
    "Database constraint: unique (competitionId, userId) for Results to prevent joining twice.",
    "Add a persistent, app-specific \"mcubes user ID\" for each user profile (separate from auth provider identifiers).",
    "Introduce paid competitions via Razorpay integration (test credentials first), with a competition entry fee and payment-gated participation where applicable.",
    "Extend data model to support multiple events per competition (event catalog includes 2x2, 3x3, 4x4, 5x5, Skewb, Megaminx, Clock, 3x3 OH, Pyraminx).",
    "Competition integrity: when a user starts a competition/event, persist a server-side session lock and session token; enforce single active session to reduce replay (second tab / refresh / direct URL re-entry).",
    "Competition integrity: scrambles should be fetched progressively from the server (not all at once); gate access to the next scramble until the prior attempt is successfully stored server-side.",
    "Resilience: persist attempt progress/state (e.g., currentScrambleIndex, inspectionStartTimestamp, solveStartTimestamp) so the solve flow can recover after refresh/offline without allowing duplicate submissions."

    "After Version 8 deployment, the paid competition \"Pay Now\" button is now idle (no processing state, no Razorpay Checkout popup, no visible error), indicating the click handler/flow may not be firing or is being short-circuited silently.",
