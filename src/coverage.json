The engine must: (1) compute Ao5 by dropping best and worst of 5, (2) include +2 penalties in time calculations, (3) handle DNF attempts, (4) return Ao5 as DNF if there are 2 or more DNFs, and (5) apply WCA inspection overage rules server-side for each solve: if the competitor does not start the solve within 15 seconds of inspection start, auto-apply +2 to that solve; if the competitor exceeds 17 seconds, auto-mark that solve as DNF. If these rules are already correctly implemented in current server logic, do not change them.",

Specifically: if the user already has an active in-progress session for (competitionId, event), the start/resume path must return (or otherwise allow the frontend to obtain) a valid session token and the solve flow must be able to fetch the current eligible scramble using that session token.",
